## Part 1: Project Setup: Creating the Repositiory

1. Open a Terminal and navigate to a file location where you would like to store your project.

2. Create a new directory for your project: 

    !!! note "Directory Name"
          In this tutorial, we are calling our project 'go-project'. If you would like to name your porject something els, replace 'go-project' with your desired project name.

    ```bash
    mkdir go-project
    cd go-project
    ```

3. Initialize a new Git repository:
    ```bash
    git init
    ```

!!! note "Note about GitHub"
    If you were adding your project to a remote github repository, you would do that here. However we are only covering setting up the local project and dev container in this tutorial.
